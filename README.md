# Combined-power-control-of-a-grid-connected-1.5-MW-PMSG-based-wind-turbine
In this master thesis, a real world problem has been addressed analytically. First section was dedicated for the wind power generation and dc link capacitor charging issue. The second was more complex than the first part since it is very much difficult to be synchronized with the grid. In the last section a unique torque controller has been designed and the desired virtual inertia control mechanism has been implemented .The results found in the end fulfills the goal of this thesis:
